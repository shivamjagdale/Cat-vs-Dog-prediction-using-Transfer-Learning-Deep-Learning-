Cat vs Dog prediction using Transfer Learning (Deep Learning)

Here we are about 25,000 images of cat and dog and we will process them and when you give a new image it should tell you if that image is cat or dog. 
Here we are using Transfer Learning and the pretrained model which we are using is called Mobile_net_v2. 

The prediction we got for our model is 97% meaning for 100 images our model can predict correctly 97 images and tell us if that image is dog or cat.
