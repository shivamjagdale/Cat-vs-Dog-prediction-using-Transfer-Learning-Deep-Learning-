# Cat-vs-Dog-prediction-using-Transfer-Learning-Deep-Learning-
Cat vs Dog prediction using Transfer Learning (Deep Learning)

Here we are about 25,000 images of cat and dog and we will process them and when you give a new image it should tell you if that image is cat or dog. 
Here we are using Transfer Learning and the pretrained model which we are using is called Mobile_net_v2. 

The prediction we got for our model is 97% meaning for 100 images our model can predict correctly 97 images and tell us if that image is dog or cat. 
For some reason if you can't see the file or it shows some error download the file. 

Dataset :-https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
Things you need to carry out in the project :- 
Image pred :-

1) Upload the suff and the json file from the kaggle 

2) Import the cat vs dog dataset from it 

3) Import all the libraries 

4) zip out the contents 

5) See the no of files in train data 

6) See the names of the files in train data 

7) See the images 

8) Count the no of images in train data file 

9) Then resize the image 

10) Look at the resized folder names then print out the images to see if they are resized 

11) Find the no of images of dogs and cat in a resized folder 

12) Give the images some lables 

13) And now see if the labels have actually given. 

14) Convert the images to numpy array before feeding them to our DL  

15)  Now split them into X & Y.

16) Then training and testing 

17) Scale the numpy arrays 

18) Now towards building neural netowrk. We are using mobile net one here so import all the libraries. 

19) Now download the mobile net using the url, and then give it some specifications 

20) now keras.seq and look at model summary

21) Now compile 

22) model fit 

23) Model evaluate

24) input your predictions
